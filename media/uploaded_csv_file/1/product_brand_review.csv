shoe,Nike,"Very, very sad."
shoe,Nike,"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"

shoe,Jordan,It was equally awful.

jacket,THE NORTH FACE,very slow at seating even with reservation.
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat."
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,I was VERY disappointed!!
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,This place is horrible and way overpriced.
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
jacket,THE NORTH FACE,Con: spotty service.
jacket,Levi's,"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."
jacket,Levi's,But then they came back cold.
jacket,Levi's,"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
jacket,Levi's,The real disappointment was our waiter.
jacket,Levi's,My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
jacket,Levi's,The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
jacket,Levi's,"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
jacket,Levi's,If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
jacket,Levi's,She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
jacket,Levi's,After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
jacket,Levi's,Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
jacket,Nautica,It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
jacket,Nautica,But I don't like it.
jacket,Nautica,Hell no will I go back
jacket,Nautica,We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
Handbag,AQUA,"""I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back """"ya'all""""."""
Handbag,AQUA,I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
Handbag,AQUA,The ambiance isn't much better.
Handbag,AQUA,"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."
Handbag,AQUA,The food wasn't good.
Handbag,AQUA,"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."
Handbag,AQUA,What happened next was pretty....off putting.
Handbag,AQUA,"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
Handbag,AQUA,Overpriced for what you are getting.
Handbag,AQUA,I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
Handbag,AQUA,"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
Handbag,AQUA,"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
Handbag,GANNI,We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
Handbag,GANNI,Food was below average.
Handbag,GANNI,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
Handbag,GANNI,"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
Handbag,GANNI,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
Handbag,GANNI,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
Handbag,GANNI,"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
Handbag,GANNI,It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
Handbag,GANNI,I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
Handbag,GANNI,The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
Handbag,L'alingi,Spend your money and time some place else.
Handbag,L'alingi,A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
Handbag,L'alingi,the presentation of the food was awful.
Handbag,L'alingi,I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
Handbag,L'alingi,I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Handbag,L'alingi,Appetite instantly gone.
Handbag,L'alingi,Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
Handbag,L'alingi,"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
Handbag,L'alingi,"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
