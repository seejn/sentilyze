feedback and gain valuable insights into customer sentiment. However, one of the challenges

feedback to gain insights into what customers like and dislike about their products and
services. This enables merchants to make data-driven decisions to improve their products and
services, increase customer satisfaction, and ultimately, improve their bottom line. The system

present category based reviews which might be extremely helpful to businesses.

insights into customer sentiment by analyzing existing customer feedback in a user-friendly
